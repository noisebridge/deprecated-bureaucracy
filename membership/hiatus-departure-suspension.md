Departure
=========

If a Member wishes to leave the membership, they have to inform the secretary. After leaving the membership, they may rejoin by the normal procedure.


Suspension
==========

Noisebridge may suspend someone's membership. A Member is not entitled to full participation in the consensus process around a proposal to suspend that person's membership. If a Member has been suspended, they shall no longer be considered a Member of Noisebridge for any purpose, including but not limited to, full participation in the consensus process. 


Hiatus
======

Noisebridge allows members to go on hiatus if they wish to temporarily suspend their membership. Hiatus may be used when a Member will not be involved in Noisebridge for an extended period, such as if they are traveling.

Members on hiatus are not entitled to full participation in Noisebridge's consensus process.

Going on hiatus
---------------

If a member wishes to go on hiatus, they must do the following things:

* Add the `[[Category:Hiatus]]` tag to their wiki user page
* Notify the secretary that they are going on hiatus and specifying the date on which they intend to return

If a member going on hiatus will not have regular internet acces or has specific communication needs during their hiatus period, it is their responsibility to arrange this with the secretary before they go on hiatus. 

While on hiatus (termination)
-----------------------------

* A member may extend their term of hiatus at any time by contacting the secretary.
* If a member on hiatus does not contact the secretary within three months from the date on which they intended to return, their membership shall expire. If that person wants to rejoin Noisebridge, they must go through the joining process again.
* If a member did not specify an exact time at which they intend to return from hiatus, their membership shall expire four months after they initially went on hiatus. If that person wants to rejoin Noisebridge, they must go through the joining process again. 

Returning from hiatus
---------------------

To return from hiatus, a member must remove the `[[Category:Hiatus]]`` tag from their wiki user page and notify the secretary that they have returned. Members' status returns as soon as these two tasks are complete. Members' full participation in the consensus process returns one calendar month after these two tasks are complete.
