This is Noisebridge's consensus process. It is not a general description of consensus.

Process
=======

A proposal for consensus must be raised for discussion at a regular [[community meeting]](./meetings.md). Both members and non-members may raise items for consensus. If a proposal reaches initial consensus at the meeting at which it was proposed, it must be added to the [`Current Consensus Items` page](https://noisebridge.net/wiki/Current_Consensus_Items) on the Noisebridge wiki before 24 hours have passed after the end of the meeting.

At a subsequent community meeting, any items which have previously reached initial consensus and been recorded as described are elegible for final consensus. If a proposal is modified at a meeting, it is not elegible for final consensus at that meeting. However, if it reaches a new initial consensus at that meeting (as if it had been proposed at that meeting) and is recorded as described, it will be elegible for final consensus at a future meeting.


Purpose
=======

The purpose of this delay is to ensure that Members who do not attend every community meeting have the opportunity to learn about a proposal through the [`Current Consensus Items` page](https://noisebridge.net/wiki/Current_Consensus_Items) page and either attend or find a proxy to attend a future meeting and discuss or object to the proposal.


Participation
=============

Only Members of Noisebridge are entitled to full participation in Consensus. If any Member who is physically present at a community meeting objects to a proposal, that proposal does not represent the consensus of Noisebridge, and cannot reach initial or final consensus. Any Member is free to object to a proposal in order to proxy the opinion of a Member who is not present, or that of an associate member or guest.


Policies
========

Proposals to modify Noisebridge's policies and procedures — or other material canonically stored in that git repository — must include a branch which can be merged if that proposal reaches final consensus. If the proposal reaches consensus, it is the responsibility of the secretary to merge the changes.
