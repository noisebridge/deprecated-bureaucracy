Noisebridge is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, housing status, or language. We do not tolerate harassment of people at our events or space in any form.

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, persistent uninvited communication, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Different users of Noisebridge have different levels of comfort about sex and porn. Nobody should be forced to experience sexual or sexualised language or imagery. This does not mean that such material is prohibited, just that such conversations, presentations, &c. should include only interested and consenting people.

When you are working on a sex- or porn-related project at Noisebridge, or are running such an event or presentation, provide reasonable notice and warning to allow others the opportunity to opt out if they wish. With this — as anything else — each person has a responsibility to be considerate of the comfort levels of others. Discussions, projects, and events of this nature should strive to exist in a culture of respect and consent.

People asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

People violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the space or the event at the discretion of any Noisebridge member.
